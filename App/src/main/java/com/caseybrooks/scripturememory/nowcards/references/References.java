 * References is for a new type of Dashboard card and notification for the more
 * active Scripture Now Memory System (which hasn't been created just yet). Ideally,
 * this will pick a verse from the ic_database and display the text to the user,
 * along with 4 references. These references will hopefully be picked from the
 * ic_database as well, assuming they have saved 4 verses, and the user must choose
 * the reference that fits the verse text. The result of their selection will then
 * suggest a memorization level for the user, based on how many times they have
 * gotten this correct for that verse.
