GETTING STARTED

This project is built using the Gradle build system and Android Studio.
The project as-is will not compile because I have hidden the API key per request from Bibles.org, which provides the verse text for the app. This means that the resource bibles_org will be missing from the code in many places. If you wish to contribute to this project, contact me and I will send you a resource file to include in the project with the private API key needed. Just make sure that you do not add it in such a way that it gets uploaded to the repo. The file is in the .gitignore file, so as long as you don't change the filename or anything, you should be just fine.
