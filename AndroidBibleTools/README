Android Bible Tools 

What is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Android Bible Tools seeks to simplify the process of finding and using Bible
verses in your app. It also seeks to unify sharing verses among the Android
ecosystem.


The Problem
	While it can be quite simple to package a few Strings for the reference and 
	the text of a verse in an object, you are left with an issue of how to make
	it more extensible. How do you find which verse comes next? Are these two 
	verses in the same chapter or book? How can a collection of verses be sorted,
	tagged, downloaded, or printed? And more more importantly, how can this be 
	done in a way that is simple, intuitive, and transparent to the programmer.

The Solution
	Of course, the most intuitive way to use verses in an app are to use them as 
	you would any other time. To this end, there are several basic objects and 
	collections that make using verses very simple. There are single Verse objects, 
	which correspond to a single verse in the Bible. A verse will always "point" 
	to the same verse, no matter which translation it is or how it should be 
	displayed. Likewise, a Passage is a set of Verses that are consecutive and
	in the same Book of the Bible. Creating and using the Verses is just as easy
	as you would expect:

	Verse(String reference)
	Verse(Book book, int chapter, int versenum)
	Passage(String reference)
	Passage(Verse start, Verse end)
		*any constructor can optionally set the Version as the first argument. The
		default Version is KJV

	The following are some of the methods that can be called on these objects
	next()
	previous()
	getReference()
	getText()
	compareTo(Verse verse)


How to Install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	-- Dependencies --
JSOUP, which can be dowloaded from http://jsoup.org/. The current version as of writing
this is 1.7.3. 

In Android Studio, you must import this project as a new module. Then add the 
	jsoup JAR to the /lib folder in the module, and make sure the build.gradle 
	has the following added:

	dependencies {
		compile files('lib/jsoup-1.7.3.jar')
	}

	And then whichever modules you need to use the library must have the following
	in their build.gradle:

	dependencies {
	    compile project(':AndroidBibleTools')
    }
