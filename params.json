{"name":"Scripturememory","tagline":"My personal Android application project","body":"This is the official webpage for Scripture Memory Notifications, an Android application to help Christians memorize Bible verses. This application is completely open-source. To obtain the source and start working on it for yourself, fork this repo and get to work!\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you don't want to help with this project you can simply download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.caseybrooks.scripturememory)\r\n\r\n### What is it?\r\nI believe that Christians should strive to keep the Word of God in our heart and on our mind, and part of this is memorizing Scripture. This application puts an ongoing notification into your Android device's notification drawer, so that every time you pull it down, you see the verse you want to memorize and try to remember it. All verses are saved in a beautiful Google Now-inspired layout, allowing one to set specific verses as \"current\" or \"memorized\" and try to memorize those that aren't yet committed to memory. The app also includes a Verse of the Day feature, which displays a new Bible verse every day, courtesy of VerseOfTheDay.com.\r\n\r\n### How's it Doing?\r\nScripture Memory Notifications is currently in V2.0, which means it recently had a major overhaul of the UI and the addition of a bunch of new features. Among these include:\r\n\r\n* Ability to share verses from another app, such as Bible Gateway or Youversion (or any app that sends plain text). This allows for faster addition of verses to your collection.\r\n* Ability to share a verse in your collection to social media, like Twitter.\r\n* A new app icon, which was made entirely by me, as opposed to the old one which was taken from somewhere on the web and changed slightly (I'm still not entirely sure how OK that was). I am working to create a stronger brand on this app, and part of it includes the new icon and the app's color scheme to match.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the app has seen a total of 945 downloads and 12 ratings from the Google Play Store. I am currently looking into adding it to the Amazon Appstore as well.\r\n\r\n### What's Next?\r\nThis app is still very-much under development, meaning I am adding new features all the time. However, I am just one man, and a college student at that, and so updates will likely not be as often as I would wish, due to my schedule and other obligations. But below is a list of some features I am planning on implementing in the near-future:\r\n\r\n* Multiple themes\r\n* Translation for other languages\r\n* In-app verse lookup, courtesy of BibleGateway.com\r\n* Tag verses and add them to custom lists\r\n* In-app purchases of verse lists\r\n* Homescreen widgets for the current notification verse and the Verse of the Day\r\n* Additional tools to aid in memorization\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI work alone on this project, but that's OK, because it helps me to more fully understand the Android environment, as well as good programming practices and application design. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to help with this project? Or maybe you have an idea for an awesome feature but don't know how to code? Perhaps you just want to say hi, ask for prayer, or inquire about Jesus. All are highly encouraged, just drop me an email at cjbrooks12@gmail.com and I will respond promptly.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, thank you for all the support.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
