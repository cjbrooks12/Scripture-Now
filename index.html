        <p>This is the official webpage for Scripture Now!, an Android application to help Christians memorize Bible verses. This application is completely free and always open-source. To obtain the source and start working on it for yourself, fork this repo and get to work!</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you don't want to help with this project you can simply download it from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.caseybrooks.scripturememory">Google Play Store</a></p>

<a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h3>

<p>I believe that Christians should strive to keep the Word of God in our heart and on our mind, and part of this is memorizing Scripture. This application puts an ongoing notification into your Android device's notification drawer, so that every time you pull it down, you see the verse you want to memorize and try to remember it. Verses can be set to one of 5 "states" or levels of how much of a verse is memorized: None, Some, Most, or All. Verses can also be listed as Memorized, and the distinction between All and Memorized will be more apparent in a future update. The app also includes a Verse of the Day feature, which displays a new Bible verse every day, courtesy of VerseOfTheDay.com, a topical Bible search, provided by OpenBible.info, and a strongly-used intuitive tagging system. Verses can be tagged so as to create your own custom lists to memorize from. App is created in a beautiful Material Design style inspired by apps like Google Now, Gmail, and Timetable. </p>

<a id="hows-it-doing" class="anchor" href="#hows-it-doing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How's it Doing?</h3>

<p>Scripture Memory Notifications is currently in V3.0. It has seen a total of more than 3250 downloads and 58 ratings from the Google Play Store.</p>

<a id="whats-next" class="anchor" href="#whats-next" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's Next?</h3>

<p>This app is still very-much under development, meaning I am adding new features all the time. However, I am just one man, and a college student at that, and so updates will likely not be as often as I would wish, due to my schedule and other obligations. But below is a list of some features I am planning on implementing in the near-future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scripture Now system: create several new Dashboard cards and associated notifications which encourage users to remember older verses or ones in memorized states, so that they don't just learn verses but keep them committed to memory.</li>
<li>Translation for other languages</li>
<li>Additional tools to aid in memorization</li>
</ul>

<p>I work alone on this project, but that's OK, because it helps me to more fully understand the Android environment, as well as good programming practices and application design. If I alone work on the app, then I am forced to learn about everything, and cannot delegate a part I find difficult or annoying. Such as much to do with the UI, graphics, and animation. I don't like these nearly as much as working with the data behind the scenes, but it is something I must learn, because I believe that I should work as for the Lord with everything I do, even the things I don't enjoy as much. </p>

<p>Want to help with this project? Have a verse list you want to include as an official part of the app? Or maybe you have an idea for an awesome feature but don't know how to code? Perhaps you just want to say hi, ask for prayer, or inquire about Jesus. All are highly encouraged, just drop me an email at <a href="mailto:scripture.memory.app@gmail.com">scripture.memory.app@gmail.com</a> and I will respond promptly.</p>

<p>And finally, thank you for all the support.</p>
