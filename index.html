        <p>This is the official webpage for Scripture Memory Notifications, an Android application to help Christians memorize Bible verses. This application is completely open-source. To obtain the source and start working on it for yourself, fork this repo and get to work!</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you don't want to help with this project you can simply download it from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.caseybrooks.scripturememory">Google Play Store</a></p>

<a name="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h3>

<p>I believe that Christians should strive to keep the Word of God in our heart and on our mind, and part of this is memorizing Scripture. This application puts an ongoing notification into your Android device's notification drawer, so that every time you pull it down, you see the verse you want to memorize and try to remember it. All verses are saved in a beautiful Google Now-inspired layout, allowing one to set specific verses as "current" or "memorized" and try to memorize those that aren't yet committed to memory. The app also includes a Verse of the Day feature, which displays a new Bible verse every day, courtesy of VerseOfTheDay.com.</p>

<h3>
<a name="hows-it-doing" class="anchor" href="#hows-it-doing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How's it Doing?</h3>

<p>Scripture Memory Notifications is currently in V2.5. It has seen a total of more than 2500 downloads and 35 ratings from the Google Play Store.</p>

<a name="whats-next" class="anchor" href="#whats-next"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's Next?</h3>

<p>This app is still very-much under development, meaning I am adding new features all the time. However, I am just one man, and a college student at that, and so updates will likely not be as often as I would wish, due to my schedule and other obligations. But below is a list of some features I am planning on implementing in the near-future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Translation for other languages</li>
<li>Tag verses and add them to custom lists</li>
<li>In-app purchases of verse lists</li>
<li>Additional tools to aid in memorization</li>
</ul><h3>

<p>I work alone on this project, but that's OK, because it helps me to more fully understand the Android environment, as well as good programming practices and application design. If I alone work on the app, then I am forced to learn about everything, and cannot delegate a part I find difficult or annoying. Such as much to do with the UI, graphics, and animation. I don't like these nearly as much as working with the data behind the scenes, but it is something I must learn, because I believe that I should work as for the Lord with everything I do, even the things I don't enjoy as much. </p>
